def calculate_formation_energy(perfect, defective, calculator, mu_C):
    """
    Calculate formation energy for defects in graphene quantum dots (GQDs).

    This function computes the formation energy for various defects—single vacancies, divacancies,
    and Stone-Wales (STW) defects—in GQDs. It is designed to be universal, handling cases where carbon
    atoms are removed (vacancies/divacancies) or rearranged (STW), while accounting for edge
    functional groups (e.g., H, O, N) by using a separately computed chemical potential of carbon
    (mu_C) from perfect graphene.

    Parameters:
    - perfect: ASE Atoms object of the perfect GQD structure, including carbon atoms and any
               functional groups at the edges.
    - defective: ASE Atoms object of the defective GQD structure (e.g., with a vacancy, divacancy,
                 or STW defect), also including functional groups.
    - calculator: ASE calculator object (e.g., ORBCalculator), used to compute potential energies.
    - mu_C: Chemical potential of carbon (in eV), calculated separately from a relaxed perfect
            graphene structure (e.g., E_graphene / N_carbons), to avoid distortions from edge
            functional groups in GQDs.

    Returns:
    - E_form: Formation energy of the defect (in eV), reflecting the energy cost of creating the
              defect relative to the perfect structure.

    Detailed Explanation:
    --------------------
    Formation energy (E_f) quantifies the energetic cost of introducing a defect into a material.
    For GQDs, defects like vacancies (removal of one carbon), divacancies (removal of two carbons),
    and Stone-Wales defects (bond rotation without atom removal) are common. The formula must
    account for the finite size of GQDs and the presence of edge functional groups (e.g., H, O, N),
    which differ energetically from carbon in ideal graphene.

    The standard formation energy formula is derived from thermodynamics and statistical mechanics,
    where the energy of a defective system is compared to the perfect system, adjusted by the
    chemical potential of removed atoms. For GQDs, the literature suggests:

    1. **Vacancies and Divacancies:**
       - Formula: E_f = E_defective - E_perfect + n_removed * mu_C
       - Here, n_removed is the number of carbon atoms removed (1 for vacancy, 2 for divacancy),
         and mu_C is the chemical potential of carbon. This reflects the energy to create the defect
         plus the energy of the removed carbon atoms relative to a reservoir (perfect graphene).
       - Why mu_C from perfect graphene? Using mu_C from the GQD itself (e.g., E_perfect / total_atoms)
         includes contributions from functional groups, which distorts the carbon-specific energy.
         Perfect graphene provides a consistent reference for carbon’s chemical potential,
         excluding edge effects.

    2. **Stone-Wales Defects:**
       - Formula: E_f = E_defective - E_perfect
       - No atoms are removed (n_removed = 0), so the formation energy is simply the energy difference
         due to bond rearrangement. No mu_C term is needed, as the defect involves only a structural
         change.

    3. **Implementation Choices:**
       - **Counting Carbon Atoms:** The function counts only carbon atoms (symbol == 'C') to determine
         n_removed, ensuring functional groups don’t affect the calculation. This is critical for
         GQDs, where edge atoms (H, O, N) are present but not part of the defect process.
       - **Separate mu_C:** mu_C is passed as a parameter, calculated from a perfect graphene
         structure (e.g., using a function like calculate_mu_C). This aligns with best practices to
         isolate carbon’s intrinsic energy.

        formula for vacancies and divacancies.
      - Link: https://doi.org/10.1039/C4CS00499J (Check via RSC or institutional access)

    Why This Approach?
    -----------------
    - **Consistency Across Defects:** By checking n_removed, the function adapts to all defect types
      without separate implementations, making it universal.
    - **Edge Functional Groups:** Counting only carbon atoms ensures H, O, or N don’t skew results,
      and using mu_C from graphene avoids their energetic influence, as discussed in prior analyses.
    - **Literature Alignment:** The approach mirrors established methods in graphene defect studies,
      ensuring comparability with published results.

    Notes:
    - Ensure the calculator (e.g., ORBCalculator) is consistent across perfect GQD, defective GQD,
      and graphene calculations for mu_C.
    - For edge defects involving functional group disruption, relaxation (via FIRE) should handle
      structural changes, but the formula remains valid.
